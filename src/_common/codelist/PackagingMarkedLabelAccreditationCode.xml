      <cl:Name>Bio-LABEL Baden-Württemberg</cl:Name>
      <cl:Description>The products marked with the Bio-Zeichen Baden-Württemberg are regional organic foods with a traceable origin. The use or labelling is based on the ecological standards of the EC Organic Regulation supplemented with the requirement that the products must be produced in fully converted farms and, in part, on the more stringent requirements of the organic farming associations. The regional origin of the products ensures an additional ecological advantage of the products. The rationality promotes short transport and marketing channels. The independent checks of food by authorized inspection bodies and the additional supervision by the sign holder ensure a high degree of credibility of the sign. The control number printed on the products makes the controls comprehensible. The seal clearly shows the consumer that the agricultural products and products come from Baden-Württemberg. This ensures not only that the processing takes place in the region, but also that the sourcing of raw materials is 100% regional. In the production and processing of food, the guidelines of the EU Organic Regulation are used as the basis. Many products that are labelled with the Baden-Württemberg organic label are also produced according to the stricter guidelines of an organic farming association. The farms participating in the Bio-Zeichen Baden-Württemberg must be 100% organic. A partial conversion is - with the exception of products from the orchard - not permitted. Neutral controls ensure compliance with the guidelines.</cl:Description>

      <cl:Description>The Blue-White-Heart approach was born between 1993 and 2000, from a simple observation made by a dairy farmer, Jean Pierre Pasquet to an agricultural engineer, Pierre Weill. He explained to him that he noticed that in the spring, when his cows were in pasture grass, they were in better shape, and the butter he made was softer and more spreadable than in winter. From this observation, Jean-Pierre Pasquet and Pierre Weill began their reflection on the importance of preserving the food chain and valuing plants and seeds of nutritional interest. Together, they created an agriculture committed to a sustainable and social approach with breeders eager to feed their fellow citizens.</cl:Description>

      <cl:Description>The Origine France Garantie certification was created in June 2010 following the publication of Yves Jégo's report on the France brand. The certification, simple and understandable by all, is the result of a collective approach of actors who wish to work together to promote the "produce in France" and the valorization of industrial and artisan know-how. The Pro France association which promotes Origine France Garantie is made up of business leaders supporting this initiative. Its goal is: Give clear and precise information to the consumer about the French origin of the products Make known the companies that manufacture in France The Origine France Garantie certification distinguishes itself from other mentions such as "made in France", "designed in France", "Made in France" ... which are self-declarative and too loose. Origine France Garantie is the only certification that certifies the French origin of a product. It is transversal (all sectors combined) and indisputable (certification, mandatory, is carried out by an independent certifying body). The Origine France Garantie certification ensures consumers traceability of the product by giving a clear and objective indication of origin. Certification is achieved through two cumulative criteria that companies must meet to obtain it: Between 50% and 100% of the unit cost is French The product takes its essential characteristics in France</cl:Description>
