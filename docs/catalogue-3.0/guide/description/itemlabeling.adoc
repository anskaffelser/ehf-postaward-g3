== Environment, Social Responsibility and Ecological

Public actors will have requirements related to the environment, ecologically produced
food and fair trade. They will also demand that basic human rights are respected in the
product production and trade.  To be able to highlight products that meet some of these
criteria, the EHF Catalogue contains elements to document Environmental labeling and Social
certificates. The labels are connected to the relevant product or service on line level
enabling the Search engines to make them visible for the buyer during the purchasing
process. Detailed information about the different labels can be found on the issuing
partyâ€™s web-site which is referred to via an URI.

Several labels can be connected to each product.
