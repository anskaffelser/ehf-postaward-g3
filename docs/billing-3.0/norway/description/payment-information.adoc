= Payment Information

Payment information need to be provided in element `cac:PaymentMeans` in an invoice, which contains instruction about how a payment
is expected to be (e.g. credit transfer), remittance information, and either payment card information, credit transfer information
or direct debit information.

In general, there are fire different types of payments:

* Card payment - must use `cac:PaymentMeans/cac:CardAccount`
* Credit transfer - must use `cac:PaymentMeans/cac:PayeeFinancialAccount`
* Direct debit - must use `cac:PaymentMeans/cac:PaymentMandate`
* Payment by post- or bank giro - must use `cac:PaymentMeans/cac:PayeeFinancialAccount`

In the invoice the supplier can specify how a payment is expected to be, by using element `cbc:PaymentMeansCode`. The
allowed payment codes can be found in link:https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/codelist/UNCL4461/[Payment means code - code list].

//Note that, all allowed payment codes can be found in link:https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/codelist/UNCL4461/[Payment means code list],
//and need to be provided in element `cbc:PaymentMeansCode`.

See further details and examples of payment means information in link:https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/bis/#_payment_means_information[PEPPOL BIS Billing specification].


== IBAN/BBAN Payments

BBAN is a national bank account number used for national payments, while IBAN is an international bank account number
used for international payments. In EHF Billing 3.0 (PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0), BBAN and IBAN need to be applied as _credit transfer_, where
the payment means code can, for example, be 30 (credit transfer), 54 (SEPA credit transfer) or other codes from
link:https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/codelist/UNCL4461/[Payment means code - code list].

If credit transfer information is provided in the invoice the payment account identifier must be present, regarding
link:https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/bis/#cen_rules[BR-50]. Payment account identifier is a unique
identifier of the financial payment account to which a payment should be made, such as BBAN or IBAN. In the invoice,
the supplier can state the BBAN or IBAN by using the element `cac:PaymentMeans\cac:PayeeFinancialAccount\cbc:ID`.

NOTE: The payment account identifier can be a BBAN or IBAN number, not the physical text "BBAN" or "IBAN".
