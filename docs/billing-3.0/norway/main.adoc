= Introduction

EHF Invoice and Credit Note is called EHF Fakturering 3.0 in Norway. EHF Fakturering 3.0 is based on the Peppol BIS billing 3.0 specification.

EHF Fakturering 3.0 is the implementation of EN 16931 Electronic invoicing according to EU Directive 2014/55/EU for the Norwegian market through Peppol BIS billing 3.0
EHF Fakturering 3.0 is the name used in Norwegian regulation.

i: Since EHF Fakturering 3.0 is based on Peppol BIS billing 3.0 must all issues, bugs or comments to the specification be reported at the Peppol Service Desk as "Request for Change (RFC)".


[NOTE]

Since EHF Billing 3.0 is rebranding of Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 must all issues, bugs or comments to the specification be reported at the
link:https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1[OpenPeppol Service Desk] as "Request for Change (RFC)".

// Use link:https://github.com/difi/ehf-postaward-g3/issues[Github issue link] to report bugs, issues or comments to this specification.


= Implementation

OpenPeppol has created link:https://peppol.eu/peppol-bis-billing-3-0/[Peppol BIS Billing 3.0], a Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS) as implementation of EN 16931, for cross border using in Peppol. The new Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 support inclusion of national rules based on origin country of seller.

Based on work done in Peppol BIS Billing 3.0, Difi has included Norwegian rules in Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 and does not see a need to implement a different CIUS targeting the Norwegian market. Implementation of EHF Billing 3.0 is therefore done by implementing Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 without extensions or extra rules.
