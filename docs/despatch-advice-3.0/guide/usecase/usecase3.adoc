= Use case 3 - Despatch with Logistic units using GS1 Keys

This use case is a refined use of the Despatch Advice where several GS1 keys are applied within the Despatch Advice to identify various entities in the despatch advice, namely; Parties, Endpoints, Shipment id, consignment ids, logistic unit ids and product identification.

****

Description::
Describes a complete process whereby a Despatch party generates a Despatch Advice based on information about the order and the product.
The Despatch Advice enables the supplier (carrier) to provide detailed information about the content of a shipment and enables a Buyer to reconcile, or confirm, the physical shipment against the order; it provides a mirror of the shipment’s packaging details and structure of the delivery.
The Despatch Advice is sent by the Despatch party to the Consignee party when the goods are sent.

Parties involved::
Despatch party In UBL: DespatchSupplierParty) (Different legal entity than the Seller in this use case) +
Seller (In UBL: SellerSupplierParty) +
Consignee party (In UBL: DeliveryCustomerParty) (Different legal entity than the Buyer in this use) +
Buyer (In UBL: BuyerCustomerParty)

Pre Conditions::
